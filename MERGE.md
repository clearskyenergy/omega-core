# MERGE.md — how omega-core was assembled from 16 legacy repos

Measured on 2026-09-06 against the sixteen repository snapshots. Every
"canonical" pick below is the SUPERSET build unless stated; nothing was
hand-merged inside a multi-megabyte file. Items under **TODO** are the
ports Claude Code does next, in order.

## Canonical picks

| file | taken from | why |
|---|---|---|
| `editor.html` | **ogisolar** (162,782 lines, OMEGA v4.24) | superset: osa = ogisolar −28 OGI-only functions; salesdemo = ogisolar −8. Joules/NextNRG/omega/sunesol/walters family (145,666 lines) is ogisolar −17,785 lines. |
| `index.html` | **joules.ai** (312 KB) | superset of cir (+6), concord/ogisolar (+217); zero tenant strings. Loads omega-brand + omega-tenant. |
| `projects.html` | **nextnrg** (52 KB) | +434/−84 vs the 7-way shared build. Hardcoded `nextnrg.com` fallback REPLACED with config/email-domain resolution. |
| `marketplace.html` | **nextnrg** (62 KB) | +341/−101 vs shared. Hardcoded WORKSPACES literal demoted to `LEGACY_WORKSPACES` fallback. |
| `omega-tools.js` | **clearsky-portal** (39.9 KB) | largest registry; nextnrg/sunesol carry a 19.6 KB subset. Added `catalog()` alias. |
| `omega-brand.js`, `omega-terms.js`, `omega-sso.js` | identical across 7–10 repos | byte-identical; verified by hash. |
| `omega-assets.js`, `omega-delivery.js` | joules/cir/walters | identical where present; treated as core optional modules. |
| `omega-legal.js`, `omega-legal-docs.js` | salesdemo | signing gate; core module. |
| every other `*.html` tool | largest copy across repos | see `git log` for the per-file source. |
| `api/*.js` (legacy 11) | largest copy across repos | `score.js` from osa, `validation.js` from nextnrg, rest from clearsky-portal. |

## What moved where

| destination | contents | from |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin/` | tools.csebuilders.com hub + `admin-console.js` (the MASTER INDEX) | clearsky-portal |
| `/console/` | alpha.clearskyomega.com ops console + intake + ops-data | omega-main |
| `/portals/finance/` | financing portal (fin_* collections) — separate product surface | finance-main |
| `/tenants/osa/` | JV partner portal, whole repo, own shell | osa-main |
| `/tenants/solela/` | ComEd pipeline shell (index.html) + IL data | solela-main |
| `/tenants/joules/` | omega-fleet.js, fleet.html, commission.html | joules.ai |
| `/tenants/tremco/` | tremco-netzero.js, tremco-patches.js, preview | tremco |
| `/tenants/spatco/` | spatco-ev-estimate.html | SPATCO |
| `/tenants/cir/` | intake.html, queue.html (CIR's variants) | cir |
| `/tenants/<others>/` | logos + legacy `config.js` (kept for the fallback path) | each repo |
| `/docs/` | all README/INTEGRATION/PRICING/etc. markdown | clearsky-portal, salesdemo |
| `/workers/` | `comed-proxy-worker-v10.js` only (v2–v9 dropped) | clearsky-portal |
| `/scripts/` | backfill-orgid, check-rules, build_ilshines + NEW audit/seed | mixed |

Dropped: nine superseded Cloudflare worker versions, `_test_overlay.js`,
`overlay-demo.html`, duplicate PDFs/PPTX/XLSX binaries (kept in `/docs/`
where referenced), `sunesol-portal.zip`, `demo-clearskyomega.zip`.

## NEW in omega-core

**Self-serve signup (decided 2026-09-06):** `start.html` on the hub host
`app.clearskyomega.com` → `api/tenant-signup.js` creates the tenant
PENDING (work email only; public providers refused via
`api/_lib/public-domains.js`); `api/tenant-approve.js` (staff) flips it
live. Second person from the same domain auto-joins as member.
`omega-tenant.js` handles hub routing and the "being set up" screen.
`config.js` at the root is the ONE platform config (no tenant block).

- `omega-tenant.js` — hostname → `tenant_public/{host}` → `CLEARSKY_CONFIG.tenant`; post-auth entitlements from `omega_orgs/{org}` + `billing/current` + `members/{uid}`; hostname lock; suspension gate; wraps `OmegaBrand.resolve`.
- `api/_lib/admin.js`, `api/set-role.js`, `api/opportunity.js`, `api/rfq.js`, `api/stripe-create.js`, `api/stripe-portal.js`, `api/stripe-webhook.js`, `api/tenant-branding.js`.
- `scripts/audit-counts.js`, `scripts/seed-omega-orgs.js`, `tenants/*/tenant.json`.
- `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` with the control-plane blocks applied and `tenant_public` added.
- `vercel.json` hostname rewrites (alpha → console, tools → admin, osa/solela → tenant shells).

## TODO — Claude Code sessions, in order

1. **Port the AHJ research block into editor.html.** The Joules family has
   `renderAhj, research, pass1, pass2, mergeResearched, ask, byTemplateKey,
   sysLine, toKeys` (≈ lines 23,800–24,300 of joules.ai/editor.html);
   ogisolar's build does not. Port it verbatim; do not rewrite.
2. **Extract OGI-only functions** from `editor.html` into
   `tenants/ogisolar/ogi-ext.js`: `root_OGI, ogiPanel, tierGate, snapTier,
   typologyAuto, siteParcel, siteSolarMwAc, siteStructures,
   siteSubstationKind, selectGen, hourFive, infraGap, retrofitCost,
   scheduleRisk, exitValue, conversion, unverified` and the 8 salesdemo
   deltas (`button, coverageOf, create, drop, links, picks, rating, update`).
   Add an extension hook in editor.html that loads `/tenants/<slug>/*-ext.js`
   when `OmegaTenant.tenant.shell` names it.
3. **Joules placeholder buttons** (`omegaJoulesSoon`, two ribbon buttons)
   → `tenants/joules/joules-ext.js` via the same hook.
4. **Diff the older editor builds** — SPATCO (73 K lines), iqgen (82 K),
   tremco (110 K), cir (140 K) — against canonical and list any function
   present there and absent in canonical. Expect none; confirm.
5. **Wire `verticals/{v}.defaultWidgets`** into the index dashboard palette
   (the `dashboard_layouts` code at index.html ≈ line 5150–5215) and add
   `omega_orgs/{org}/layouts/default` as the org-level starter.
6. **Opportunity/RFQ client hooks**: in editor.html, on SKU placement call
   `POST /api/opportunity`; in the BOM panel add "Request for Quote" →
   `POST /api/rfq`. Add the Opportunities/RFQ inbox widget (reads
   `collectionGroup('recipients')` and `opportunities` where vendorOrgId).
7. **account-settings.html** → branding form (logo upload to
   `tenants/{org}/`, `POST /api/tenant-branding`), members table with role
   dropdown (`POST /api/set-role`), "Manage billing" (`POST /api/stripe-portal`).
8. **admin/admin-console.js** → point the client inventory at `omega_orgs`;
   add a PENDING SIGNUPS queue (`omega_orgs where status == 'pending'`)
   with Approve/Reject buttons calling `/api/tenant-approve`; tier/addon
   editors, subscription-due, Stripe create.
9. **Move pricing/scoring logic server-side** per CLAUDE.md IP section:
   ev-cost-workbook unit-rate bands, valuestack dispatch, proforma math.
10. **Consolidate the orgAlias map** into one exported constant imported by
    the four clients (rules stay hand-mirrored).

## Decisions made (2026-09-06)

- New workspaces go live only after ClearSky approval (`status: pending`).
- Work email required; personal providers are refused at signup.
- Same-domain colleagues auto-join as `member`.
- Trial length: 30 days (`TRIAL_DAYS` env, default 30).

## Decisions pending (Tommy)

- [ ] Remove `sunesol.com` / `ogisolar.com` from `isConsoleViewer()`?
- [ ] Flip legacy `fin_projects/{projectId}/{file}` Storage write to `if false`?
- [ ] Same for `mkt_projects/` Storage write?
- [ ] Delete the deprecated `intake_requests` rules block (confirm collection empty first)?
- [ ] Which terms gate survives: `termsAcceptances` or `legal_acceptances`?
- [ ] OSA: sign-in domain / orgId for `tenants/osa/tenant.json`.
- [ ] Verify every hostname in `tenants/*/tenant.json` (they were inferred from the recipe `<n>.csebuilders.com` / `<n>.clearskyomega.com`).

## Verification before first deploy

```
npm install
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="$(cat sa.json)" npm run audit > audit-before.json
npm run seed:dry            # read tenants/*/tenant.json, print the plan
# review, then:
npm run seed:apply
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage      # from this repo
# Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains: add
#   app.clearskyomega.com and *.clearskyomega.com (each tenant host)
# Vercel: add app.clearskyomega.com + wildcard *.clearskyomega.com
# grep the LIVE rules for isTenantAdmin, opportunities, tenant_public
vercel --prod               # to next.clearskyomega.com first, NOT a tenant host
# sign in as each tenant via adminDomains preview; compare project counts
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="$(cat sa.json)" npm run audit > audit-after.json
node scripts/audit-counts.js --diff audit-before.json audit-after.json
```

## IP: logic that is still in the browser  (2026-09-06)

CLAUDE.md: *"Pricing, scoring, dispatch, eligibility, and financial modeling
logic runs in `/api/`, never in the browser"*, and it names **site viability
scoring** among the examples that must be server-side. Three engines added or
touched this session do not yet comply. Recorded here rather than fixed
quietly, because each is a real move with a blocker attached.

- [ ] **`omega-site-intel.js` — the grid score.** The whole model ships to the
      browser: the 35/25/15/15/10 component weights, the voltage-to-MW capacity
      ladder, the distance bands and the hazard setback formula. Any tenant can
      read the screening methodology in devtools.
      **The split:** parsing, feature classification and geodesy stay
      client-side — they are mechanical, and the KMZ never leaves the machine.
      Only `gridScore()` moves, to `/api/site-score`, behind a token check and
      a `billing/current` read.
      **Not blocked.** `api/_lib/verify-token.js` (added this session) verifies
      a Firebase ID token against Google's public certificates and reads the
      caller's own billing record through the Firestore REST API, so this needs
      no service account. It is the reason the tool can be sold at Deluxe at
      all: a `data-cap` panel is an upsell, not a gate.

- [ ] **The permitting engine (`editor.html`, OMEGA PERMIT).** Templates, the
      review-type planning bands and the CPM pass are all client-side. Lower
      priority than the grid score — the code references are public and the
      jurisdiction packs are the asset — but the bands and the trigger logic
      are the product.

- [x] **BOM → partner routing.** Already correct. `api/rfq.js` owns the routing
      rule and `firestore.rules` refuses `create` on `rfqs` and its
      `recipients` subcollection to everyone else, so a browser cannot route
      its own BOM. The editor posts the whole BOM and the server decides the
      slices. **Blocked on `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`** — this one needs to
      write, and the rules deny the caller that write by design, so the
      read-only path above cannot substitute.

## Also outstanding  (2026-09-06)

- [ ] `/omega-settings.js` 404s on seven tools; `/omega-intake.js` on one.
      Nothing references `OmegaSettings` anywhere, and
      `interconnection-study.html` carries a "deploy it alongside this tool"
      fallback — so the module was planned and never written. Build it or drop
      the feature; it is a product call, not cleanup.
- [ ] No Storage rule for `referrals/{orgId}/{referralId}/{file}`. Attachments
      fail with `storage/unauthorized` and the block degrades to links-only, as
      its own footer documents. The documented rule lets any signed-in user
      write 25 MB under that path — widen `storage.rules` deliberately or not
      at all.
- [ ] Two CRM rows both named Fenecon (`c-1785202116727` "building",
      `c-1786550295378` "up"). The DUPLICATE RECORD badge is correct. Which one
      to delete is a data decision.
- [ ] `capTier: 'trial'` still to be set on `chileasing.com` — Tenants & Users
      → Manage → Editor cap → "designer only", signed in as clearsky-usa.com.

## The sidebar is written three times  (2026-09-06)

- [ ] `index.html`, `marketplace.html` and `projects.html` each implement the
      left nav separately. They have already drifted twice in ways that
      shipped: the My Applications toggle fought `style.display` on two of the
      three while the CSS collapsed with an `.open` class, and `projects.html`
      carried the submenu populator without `omega-tools.js`, so that list
      could never have had anything in it.

      Both are fixed, and a third bug of the same shape is available whenever
      somebody touches one page and not the others. The nav wants to be one
      shared partial or one `omega-nav.js`, the way `omega-brand.js` and
      `omega-tenant.js` already are — the marketplace copy's own comment
      explains that it was written separately to avoid depending on five of
      the dashboard's private internals, which is the right instinct and the
      wrong conclusion: the fix is a public API, not a third copy.
